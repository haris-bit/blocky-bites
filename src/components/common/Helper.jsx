// FAQ DATA
export const faqsData = [
  {
    question: "Why Would I Buy a Blocky Bite?",
    answer: `This jawn will give you access to a
whole bunch of things: an owners-only social media, exclusive owner’s t-shirt, discounted
merchandise, IRL discounts and coupons, in-game characters, in-person events, and much more
to come.`,
    delay: "200",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I Buy the NFT?",
    answer: `
    To get on the whitelist, you must connect your wallet and input some basic
information on your account page. This will give you access to our pre-sale launch at the top of
our website.`,
    delay: "500",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a Whitelist?",
    answer:
      "A whitelist is an entry into gaining access to our pre-sale process. This allows a select group of beasts to get the NFTs at a discounted rate before the public mint process.",
    delay: "700",
  },
  {
    question: "What is a Public Mint and Where is it Going to Happen?",
    answer: `
    A public mint is the official launch of Blocky Bite NFTs. This will allow
users to purchase/mint an NFT through our website. This will take place following the pre-sale
process.`,
    delay: "900",
  },
  {
    question: "What is an NFT?",
    answer:
      'At a high-level, NFTs are "non-fungible tokens" that cannot be replicated or reproduced: they are unique. A Bitcoin is an example of a fungible token since it can be traded in exchange for  another Bitcoin while holding the same value. Think of an NFT as a piece of artwork. No art is ever the same whether it\'s the design, material, artist, or age of the piece.',
    delay: "1100",
  },
  {
    question: "Can’t I just Screenshot an NFT?",
    answer:
      "This is one of the most common questions we get. Yes, you could in theory screenshot an NFT, but it does not hold nearly the same value as the original. NFTs are on the Blockchain, usually the Ethereum Network, which creates an immutable (unchangeable) and distributed ledger. So,  any network participant can verify the authenticity of your NFT, and no one can alter it in any way. Upon receiving your Blocky Bite, it will be assigned a unique token identifier that makes your NFT truly one of a kind. If you choose to purchase a Blocky Bite, you can be assured that  you are the sole owner of your NFT.",
    delay: "1250",
  },
  {
    question: "What is Blockchain?",
    answer:
      "A blockchain is a type of distributed database or ledger that is used to record transactions and store information electronically. It is made up of blocks of data that are linked together in a chain, with each block containing a set of information. Blockchains are decentralized, meaning  that they are not controlled by a single entity, and they use complex algorithms to ensure the security and integrity of the data they store. They are often used in cryptocurrency systems, such as Ethereum, to record and verify financial transactions, but they have many other potential uses as well, such as in supply chain management and voting systems. The key advantage of  blockchain is that it allows for the creation of a secure and tamper-proof record of data without the need for a central authority or trusted third party.",
    delay: "1400",
  },
  {
    question: "How does Blockchain Relate to Blocky Bites?",
    answer: `Blocky Bite NFTs represent unique digital ownership securely stored on the
blockchain, ensuring authenticity and preventing duplication. NFT owners enjoy an exclusive
Blocky Bites T-shirt, providing a tangible and real-world perk for being part of the community.
Smart contracts associated with each NFT unlock “The Block” (an owners-only social media),
discounts on merchandise, access to unique video game characters, and exclusive real-world
events. Beyond the digital space, NFT ownership extends to discounted merchandise, video
game perks, and invitations to in-person events, creating a seamless blend of digital and physical
experiences. Emphasizing the security and transparency of blockchain, Blocky Bite NFTs not
only offer individual benefits, but also foster a community of collectors sharing a passion for the
project.`,
